is $150, and it applies only to single plant listings. - This cargo fee is paid only by the Receiver at
checkout. - Wholesale plants have separate cargo charges and do not count toward this $150 air cargo
fee or toward Shipping Credit eligibility. - The $150 cargo fee becomes free as Shipping Credit when: 
There are 15 or more single plant listings in the combined order (Receiver + Joiners) And the total
spend reaches $500 or more - Once conditions are met, a $150 Shipping Credit is applied back to the
Receiver’s wallet only. - Joiners do not receive Shipping Credit, as they do not pay air cargo fees.</Text>

Indonesia: Ships once a month - Philippines: Ships once a month If you order plants only from
Thailand, your Plant Flight options will be weekly. If you mix plants from different countries, your
shipment will follow the next available combined flight, which may be later than Thailand-only orders.
During checkout, you will be shown three available Plant Flight schedules to choose from. If you
already have an existing order on an upcoming flight, new plants added before cut-off will automatically
join the same flight. Cut-Off Rule: The cut-off date is 5 days before the Plant Flight date — after this,
new plants cannot join that flight and will be scheduled for the next one.</Text>

continue via UPS: - $50 for the first plant (charged to Receiver) - $5 for each additional plant in the
same flight This UPS fee is tied to the Receiver’s delivery, and Joiners share the same delivery route.
8. Live Arrival Guarantee If a plant arrives dead on delivery, you may request compensation in Shipping
Credit or plant value credit, issued to the Receiver’s account. - Claims must be submitted within the
official claim window. - Mild import stress—like leaf yellowing, softness, or droop—is considered normal
and not covered.</Text>
